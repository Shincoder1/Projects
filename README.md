## About Me

I am a passionate computer science student with a keen interest in cybersecurity and networking. My projects revolve around cryptographic algorithms, networking protocols, and custom software solutions. I am constantly learning and applying new technologies to solve practical problems.

## Projects

### AES Implementation from Scratch (Completed – November 2024)

A low-level cryptography project that implements the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm entirely from scratch without external libraries, demonstrating:
- Encryption and decryption functions
- Key expansion
- Block cipher modes

### Peer-to-Peer File Transfer Network (Completed – November 2024)

A network communication system that uses UDP and TCP protocols to enable secure file transfers between clients with:
- Multithreading support
- Concurrent connections
- Data integrity validation

### Custom Version Control System (Completed – May 2024)

A simplified version of Git built using Shell scripts, supporting:
- Commit creation
- Branch management
- Merge operations

### DIMY Digital Contact Tracing Protocol (Completed – April 2025)

A decentralized contact tracing protocol designed to help track potential exposure to COVID-19 while maintaining user privacy. It combines Diffie-Hellman key exchange, secret sharing, and Bloom filters to record and analyze encounters between devices.
- **Ephemeral Identifiers (EphID)**: Devices generate random EphIDs periodically to establish privacy. Generated using an elliptic curve. 
- **Secret Sharing**: EphIDs are split into multiple shares using the Shamir Secret Sharing scheme to enhance privacy.
- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: Enables secure exchange of secret keys for each encounter.
- **Bloom Filters**: Used to store encounter data and check if a device has been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19.

## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: C, Python, Shell, SQL, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Cryptography**
- **Network Programming**
- **Multithreading**
- **Web Development**
