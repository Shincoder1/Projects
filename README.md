## About Me
I am a passionate **computer science student** with a keen interest in **cybersecurity** and **networking**. My projects revolve around cryptographic algorithms, networking protocols, and custom software solutions. I am constantly learning and applying new technologies to solve practical problems.

## Projects

### AES Implementation from Scratch *(Completed – November 2024)*
A low-level cryptography project that implements the **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** algorithm entirely from scratch without external libraries, demonstrating:
- Encryption and decryption functions
- Key expansion
- Block cipher modes

### Peer-to-Peer File Transfer Network *(Completed – November 2024)*
A network communication system that uses **UDP** and **TCP** protocols to enable secure file transfers between clients with:
- Multithreading support
- Concurrent connections
- Data integrity validation

### Custom Version Control System *(Completed – May 2024)*
A simplified version of Git built using **Shell scripts**, supporting:
- Commit creation
- Branch management
- Merge operations

## Skills
- Programming Languages: **C**, **Python**, **Shell**, **SQL**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**
- Cryptography
- Network Programming
- Multithreading
- Web Development
